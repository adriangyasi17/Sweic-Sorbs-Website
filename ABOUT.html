         <p id="one" align="center">........a movement founded in 2022 by Keith, King and Adrian.<br>We all grew up in London and then went on to study at universities in the UK and Germany.<br>With Adrian’s biological background alongside Keith and King's specialisation in business administration and entrepreneurship,<br> our combined skills and experience resulted in the perfect match for this exciting venture.<br> King and Adrian now live in Düsseldorf, where they manage our EU logistics, while Keith is in charge of our operations in London.<br>Our passion for natural skincare started in early 2017 with our first experimentations.<br> We instantly fell in love with the science behind every formulation and the challenges of cold process soap and cream production.<br> Since then we have immersed ourselves in the world of botany as a means to harness the wonderful properties of herbs and natural oils and butters for our products.<br>In 2021 we decided to quit our jobs and moved forward with founding Sweich & Sorbs, which specialises in handmade, natural, vegan and environmentally friendly cosmetics,<br> which are sold in entirely bio-degradable packaging.<br>All ingredients used in our products are sourced from Keith and Adrian’s father’s farm in the lush hills of the Eastern Region in Ghana.<br> Shea, Coconut, Almond and Cocoa are the 4 ingredients that form the base of all our products and we always make sure that our source materials are never processed<br> so they are delivered to you in their virgin state with all their minerals intact.<br>At Sweic & Sorbs we find new ways of contributing towards a healthier and more sustainable future and this gives us great motivation.<br> We really appreciate the love and support we have received so far, and we hope to continue our journey with you.<br>With vybz, more life and blessings,<br>Keith, King & Adrian</p>
